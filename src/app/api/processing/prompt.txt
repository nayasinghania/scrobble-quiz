Generate 3 quiz questions about the data. 
Only ask questions about tracks with a cluster of 0 (don't mention cluster in the questions).
The first piece of data I will give is the time period, which you can include in the question.
For reference, playcount refers to the amount of times a track has been listened to in the time period.
Global playcount refers to total plays for all users for all time.
Provide each question, the 4 answer choices for each question, and their answers in a json format.
The entire response should be a list of question objects
The question field should be named "question", The correct response field should be named "answer", and the options field should be named "options" and contain an array.
Also, within each question, provided a field that is set to false that tracks whether the answer was correct or not.
This field should be called "correct".
